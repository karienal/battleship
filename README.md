# [BATTLESHIP](https://github.com/karienal/battleship) 
A board game based off of the hit HasbroÂ® board game!

Welcome to our little Battleship clone! It has our own little additions compared to the original game, but it should still be just as fun! 

## Installation:

  2. Click the Clone or Download button and choose to download as a zip file.
  3. Open the folder in your Terminal/Command Prompt and run ```javac *.java```.
  4. Run the file with ```java BattleshipBoard```.

The game is as of yet unfinished, so don't hesitate to tell us about any issues and bugs you end up finiding while playing!
